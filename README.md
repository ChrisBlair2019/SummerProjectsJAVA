# SummerProjectsJAVA
These are my summer projects for JAVA each commit will have info with the program I will be building. All solutions will be in JAVA. 

Plagiarism is any form be it stealing ideas, or implementations will not make you a better programmer figure out solution by yourself and you will become ten-fold better.
